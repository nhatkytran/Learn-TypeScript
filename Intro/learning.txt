--> What is TypeScript?
--> TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types
--> TypeScript is strongly typed programming language that builds \
on JavaScript, giving better tooling at any scale

--> Download TypeScript
--> Instantiate a TypeScript configuration file
tsc --init

--> Browser doesn't understand TypeScript
--> Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
tsc index.ts

--> Error happens but TS still compresses the file
--> Config this so if Error happens TS doesn't compress file
tsc --noEmitOnError index.ts --> using TS config file

*** Point to note
--> TypeScript is just a transpiler
--> TypeScript is available to us during development time
--> TypeScript is compiled to vanilla JavaScript

--> Sometimes TypeScript adds a bunch of things to implement features \
that are not available to JavaScript --> Polyfill
