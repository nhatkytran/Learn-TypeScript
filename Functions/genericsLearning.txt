--> Polymorphism
+ How can we move away from concrete implementations?
+ Why we need a polymorphic functions?
+ Why function overloads are not good solution \
for complex polymorphic implementations?

--> All About Generics
+ What are generics?
+ Where and how can generics be used?

+++ Polymorphic Implementation +++

--> Concrete Types --> string, number, boolean or even custom Types

+++ Need for Polymorphic Functions +++

--> Predicate function --> Either returns true or false

+++ Problem with Function Overloads +++
